# Portfolio_Assessment
Requisites:
1) CSV file with ticker names and/or allocations (optional)

Performs 5 actions:
1) Plots all the funds/stocks/etfs/reits in your portfolio against one another to compare their performance (interactive plot).

\
You must input the ticker symbols you have in your portfolio, the date range you want to assess the protfolio over, the initial capital you have, and the 
allotments for each of the tickers (in the same order -- I probably should create a dictionary Ticker:allotment, but this works for now)\
\
The APP version of this script creates a simple UI for inputting variables and for viewing the analysis/charts.\
