# Portfolio_Assessment
Performs 5 actions:
1) Plots all the funds/stocks/etfs/reits in your portfolio against one another to compare their performance (interactive plot).
2) Plots your overall portfolio performance against SPY and includes cummulative inflation over the same time period (interactive plot).
3) Calculates the cummulative percent return.
4) Calculates the daily sharpe ratio.
5) Calculates the anualized sharpe ratio.
\
You must input the ticker symbols you have in your portfolio, the date range you want to assess the protfolio over, the initial capital you have, and the 
allotments for each of the tickers (in the same order -- I probably should create a dictionary Ticker:allotment, but this works for now)\
